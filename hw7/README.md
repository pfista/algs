### Minimum Spanning Tree
Michael Pfister mp25234

#### Usage
`./mst.py input.txt`

MST will be saved to output.txt

#### Problem
Implement one of the MST algorithms. The input will be a graph described by an
adjacency list, with weights for each edge, and with vertices labelled 1...n. 

I will be using kruskal's algorithm to find the MST
