### Maximal Independent Sets

*Two heuristics for finding maximal independent sets are examined*

The first heuristic and code was retrieved from [Ashay Dharwadker](http://www.dharwadker.org/independent_set/)
and can be used to find a maximal independent set.

The second makes use of [networkx](https://github.com/networkx) to find a
maximal independent set.
